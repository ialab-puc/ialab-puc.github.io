In terms of cognitive robotics, our goal is to create mobile robots with perceptual and reasoning abilities to successfully operate in natural environment, mainly indoor environments using differential wheeled robots. We aim to create robots that physically interact with humans in a shared workspace, and whose main goal is to increase productivity, as well as, to facilitate and enhance the work experience of human users. In this context, our current research focuses on 3 main areas: 

i) Improve current geometric navigation systems using semantic information, 

ii) Increase the capabilities of robots to communicate with a human user using natural language, and 

iii) Increase the capabilities of a mobile robot by using mechanical arms.
