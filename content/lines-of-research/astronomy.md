Some of the people at the research group reasrch Astronomy related problems. They are astronomers and computer scientists, with common interests in data science for astronomy. 
Together with postgraduate students and professors from Harvard, we have continuous exchange programs where we travel between PUC and Harvard several times every year. 
We have open positions for talented students who want to learn data science, the main requirement is to have a strong background in computer programming, math, statistics, and the wish to work very hard.
