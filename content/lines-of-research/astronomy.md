Thanks to the quality and transparency of its skies, Chile is today one of the world leading countries in terms of research in astronomy. As a relevant fact, by the year 2020 Chile will concentrate over 70% of the worldâ€™s astronomical infrastructure. In our group, we contribute to the national research agenda in astronomy by studying how IA technologies can impact this scientific field. Our recent contributions include new tools for automatic classification of variable stars, detection of quasars, discovery of known objects, dealing with missing data, and meta classification, among others.
